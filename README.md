# odin-recipes

This repository contains a basic recipe website made with HTML.

This learning outcome is to practise my HTML skills that I have acquired through The Odin Project so far:
1. Creating a HTML boilerplate
2. Adding relative links in between different pages
3. Adding images onto the pages
