        <p class="normal">Curry rice, or kare rice (pronounced  karē raisu), is a dish that was brought to Japan during the Meiji era (1868–1912) from the British, when India was under colonial rule. It was served to the Japanese Imperial Navy to prevent thiamine (vitamin B-1) deficiency and became popular across Japan in the 1960s when curry made its appearance in restaurants and supermarkets.</p>
        <p class="normal">Nowadays Japanese curry is considered a national dish and is popular both in Japan and across the world. Its taste is quite different from any other curry you’ll find in Asia – it’s not spicy but rather sweet (which is probably why kids love it so much), savory, and sometimes a little spicy. The sauce is similar to a rich demi-glace that’s layered with spices and earthy flavors.</p>
