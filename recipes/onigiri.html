        <p class="normal">Onigiri, also called O-musubi or Nigirimeshi are Japanese Rice Balls that are hand shaped into round balls or triangles and usually wrapped in nori (seaweed). Back in the day when there was no such thing as refrigeration, the Japanese came up with a way to preserve rice by adding salt and pickled ingredients. Adding these ingredients helped keep rice fresh for longer. That’s why the most traditional onigiri’s are seasoned and filled with just salt, salted ingredients, furikake (Japanese rice seasoning with salt) and pickled ingredients like Umeboshi (pickled plum).</p>
